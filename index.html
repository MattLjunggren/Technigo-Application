  <h1> HTTPS</h1>
  <div class="description-text";>

<p> 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a> stands for "Hypertext transfer protocol secure" and is an extension of HTML used to securely 
    transfer data on the internet. The protocol was developed by Netscape and uses an encryption 
    protocal called <a href=https://www.appviewx.com/education-center/what-is-tls-ssl-protocol/>TLS/SSL</a> to secure the data.  
    The method starts as <a href=https://sectigostore.com/blog/types-of-encryption-what-to-know-about-symmetric-vs-asymmetric-encryption/>assymetric encryption</a> 
    meaning that the sender and the reciever uses two separate yet mathematically connected cryptographic keys. These keys are known as a "public key" and a 
    "private key". When a user connects to a domain the private key is verified by the domains public key, the protocol then changes to a symmetric encryption which is 
    faster providing both  safety and short transfer time. The encryption certificates which connects the keys comes pre-installed in the browser and is provided by a 
    third party software company.
